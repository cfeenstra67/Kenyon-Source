In order to ensure that students receive prompt and appropriate attention for alcohol intoxication or drug impairment and that there are no impediments to seeking such assistance, the College hereby institutes a Good Samaritan policy.  In those instances in which a student calls the Office of Campus Safety or another College office for assistance with an intoxicated or impaired student, neither the individual calling nor the student in need of assistance will be charged with violations of the Collegeâ€™s policies on alcohol and other drugs. If intoxicated/impaired students demonstrate a reckless or habitual lack of care concerning their well-being and the well-being of the campus community, they can be required to meet with a member of the student affairs staff who will determine the actions necessary to protect the welfare of the student and the campus community.
This policy is designed to save lives. The spirit of the Good Samaritan is that we all have an ethical responsibility to help people in need.  There is an expectation that students will take active steps to protect the safety and well-being of our community.
