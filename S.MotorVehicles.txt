The College does not encourage undergraduates to have automobiles on campus, and first-year students are especially advised not to have them. The College has a specified number of parking spaces and cannot exceed that number. Should students have grievances, they may file a complaint at Campus Safety, which will be heard by the Appeals Board (two students and one faculty member). The Appeals Board meets every two weeks, and all decisions are final. However, if students choose to bring a car to campus, the College emphatically disclaims all responsibility for accidents or damages to vehicles which may occur. Each student owning or operating a motor vehicle at Kenyon who fails to register it with the Office of Campus Safety within 24 hours after arrival in Gambier will be subject to a fine. Students can use only the parking decal assigned to them. Students are expected to adhere to all guidelines provided in the “Regulations for Student Operation of Motor Vehicles,” which may be obtained at the Campus Safety Office. Fines incurred must be paid within 30 days of issuance or be subject to registration hold or other disciplinary action.
