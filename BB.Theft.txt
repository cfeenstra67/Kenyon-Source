Theft is stealing another’s property or being in possession of another’s property without permission from the owner, whether that property involves the bicycle of another student or dishware from the dining hall. Each student is expected to respect the property of fellow community members and the College. If stolen property is found in a shared, common living space, all residents may be held accountable.
