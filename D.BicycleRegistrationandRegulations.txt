Bicycles must be registered when brought to campus. When registration is completed at the Office of Campus Safety, a decal will be issued that must be affixed to the frame. Students are encouraged to bring locks for their bikes and to have bikes insured in case of damage, loss or theft. Copies of the College’s bicycle regulations may be obtained at the Office of Campus Safety.
Bicycles must be stored in the shelters provided or in students’ rooms. Bikes are not allowed in hallways, stairwells, or residence-hall storage areas. Bicycles found in violation of regulations will be impounded by Campus Safety. Bicycles left out on campus, in impound or in student storage after Commencement will be donated each year.
