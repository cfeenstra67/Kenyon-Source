Computing at Kenyon is a vital tool in the educational experience.  Computer and network access is a privilege extended to all students and members of the administration, faculty and staff at the College.  Members of the Kenyon community are responsible for knowing College policies on computer use.  All students are given accounts, including Internet access, which may be used at any time without charge.  The following policies are in place to maintain control and availability to the community at large.

/italic/1./enditalic/ Users of Kenyon computing systems are not chargedfor their use of the systems.  Charges may be levied for consumption of certain supplies, such as paper or other printing supplies, or for access to commercial services over the network.  Students are provided with a limited amount of data storage on the campus network, intended for their academic work.  In addition to the limited storage available on the Kenyon network, Google Apps for Education provides unlimited storage via Google Drive.
