Kenyon College’s alcohol policy reflects its intention to adhereto state and local laws governing the use, distribution and consumption of alcoholic beverages.  Kenyon is subject to these laws and administers all policies in accordance with their current interpretation.  Thus, Kenyon’s specific alcoholic beverage regulations are designed to encourage responsible drinking and behavior by clearly stating what is expected of those who choose to consume or serve alcohol.  If alcohol is found in a shared living space where all residents are under the legal drinking age (21), all residents will be held accountable for this policy violation.  Violations of these regulations will result in disciplinary action.

/bold/2. Restraints Governing Use of Alcohol/endbold/
Because the consumption of alcohol in a campus setting raises many complex issues, including behavioral, safety and legal problems, it is necessary for the College to define certain limitations on and restrictions regarding the possession, consumption, and purchase of alcoholic beverages. Students found responsible for violating this policy will be held accountable, and they may also be required to participate in counseling, assessment, and/or treatment; this may need to take place off-campus at the student’s expense.
/italic/a./enditalic/ Kenyon expects that individuals will respect responsible standards regarding the use of alcoholic beverages for both themselves and others.  Being severely intoxicated (regardless of age) is in violation of College policy.  This may include but is not limited to being incapable of looking after oneself, endangering the welfare of oneself and/or others, and/or behaving in offensive or disorderly ways.
/italic/b./enditalic/ Drinking of alcoholic beverages and/or possessing an open container of alcohol in public campus areas or in the village, is unacceptable.

Students are encouraged to familiarize themselves with their assigned living areas per housing agreement, public property, e.g., exterior apartment property, portions of Middle Path, roadways, sidewalks, etc., where citations are more likely to be issued by law enforcement. Farr Hall, as a mixed-use facility, is subject to special rules. Drinking of alcoholic beverages in that building may take place inside rooms on the second-floor residential area only. Drinking of alcoholic beverages is prohibited elsewhere in the building, including hallways and the first floor, front patio and the vicinity of the building.

/italic/f./enditalic/ Funds administered through Student Council may not be used for the purchase of alcoholic beverages except where permitted in the Student Council Constitution.
