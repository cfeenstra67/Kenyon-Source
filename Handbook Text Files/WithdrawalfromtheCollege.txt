Students who plan to leave Kenyon for the remainder of a semester, or for a semester or more (except students studying under the auspices of the Center for Global Engagement), or permanently, must declare their intentions to the vice president for student affairs or designee by completing a declaration of withdrawal form.
Grades and credit. Grades and credit for students withdrawing from the College depend on the time of the withdrawal. The policy is as follows:• Before the end of week 12: W (no credit or grade) in all courses.• After week 12: W in all year courses;* F in all semester courses, unless the courses have been completed (in which case grade and credit are recorded), or unless the deans find the withdrawal is justified (e.g., because of illness), in which case WI is recorded.• Between the beginning of the second semester and the end of week 12: W in all year courses* and all second-semester courses.• After week 12 of the second semester: F in all courses* unless the deans find the withdrawal is justified.
/italic/*Students who complete the first semester of year courses may request credit for that work. Half credit is granted if approved by both the instructor and the student’s advisor. The grade assigned is usually, but not necessarily, the tentative grade. Instructors may require a final exam. In the absence of such a request for half credit, W is recorded as above./enditalic/
