• Initial jurisdiction for nonacademic infractions shall reside with the student affairs hearing officers, who shall make preliminary inquiry into the nature and circumstances of the complaint(s). In cases when the hearing officer does not believe the complaint could be demonstrated with a preponderance of evidence, or feels that the complaint(s) merit(s) nothing more than a warning, the hearing officer may dismiss the case or issue a warning within a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days, while the College is in session. In cases in which the hearing officer deems the complaint(s) to be more serious, he or she may refer the case to the Student Conduct Review Board. If the hearing officer does not refer the case to the Student Conduct Review Board, the student may choose to have an administrative hearing or a hearing by the Student Conduct Review Board. This referral would occur when a hearing by the community, as represented by the board, might be more appropriate because of the seriousness of the allegations made in the complaint. The Student Conduct Review Board must hear all cases referred to it.
• An administrative hearing will be held if the alleged violation occurs at a time when the Student Conduct Review Board cannot be convened.
• In cases when the hearing officer is partial or has a conflict of interest, he or she will refer the case to another hearing officer or to the Student Conduct Review Board for resolution.
• The College reserves the right to impose an interim suspension whenever individual(s) or campus group activity(ies) is/are viewed as threatening or injurious to the well-being or property of members of the College community, or to its operation.
• The referring administrator shall act as complainant on behalf of the College in cases where a student complainant is absent
