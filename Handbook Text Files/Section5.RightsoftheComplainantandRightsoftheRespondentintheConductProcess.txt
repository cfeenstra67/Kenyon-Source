In situations where the vice president of student affairs or her/his designee is unable to consider the appeal, the provost shall fulfill this role.  The appeal must be based on one or more of the following criteria:• procedural error(s) made during the original proceeding;• new information unavailable at the original proceeding;• the severity of the sanction; and/or• decision(s) made absent a preponderance of evidence.It should be noted that in an appeal, the preponderance of evidence shifts to the appellant, the appeal is heard “on the record,” i.e., on the basis of written information only, and that an appeal is not a rehearing of the case.  The letter of appeal must be filed with the dean of students or her/his designee within three business days of written notification to the respondent of the outcome of the Student Conduct Review Board or administrative hearing.  The dean of students or her/his designee will normally make a decision regarding the written appeal within 21 business days of receipt of the written appeal.  In the presence of unusual circumstances, only the president of the College may grant additional time to the dean of students or her/his designee for consideration of the appeal.  In considering an appeal, dean of students or her/ his designee may deny the appeal and maintain the decision of the Student Conduct Review Board or administrative hearing officer, grant the appeal and modify the sanction or penalty, or refer the case back to the Student Conduct Review Board or administrative hearing officer for further deliberation.  The decision of the dean of students regarding the case shall be final and not subject to further appeal.
