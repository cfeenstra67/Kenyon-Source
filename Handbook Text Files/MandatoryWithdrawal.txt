The College may require the withdrawal of a student who has any illness or condition or who exhibits any behavior that might endanger or be damaging to the health or welfare of the student or any other member of the College community, or whose illness, behavior or condition is such that it cannot be managed effectively while the student is enrolled. A student who leaves the College under such circumstances may be required to spend at least one academic year away before readmission is considered. Any student who is on conditional enrollment or any other sanction through the Committee on Academic Standards (CAS) at the time of withdrawal must also have her or his readmission reviewed by CAS prior to return.
