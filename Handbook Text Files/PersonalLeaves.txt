Students in good standing may request a personal leave of absence (withdrawal) from a dean and, if granted, take time off from the College. Such time away, often as a period of reassessment and self- evaluation, can prove to be educationally beneficial. A leave may be granted for not less than one semester and not more than one year. Students who take personal leaves of absence are readmitted with the approval of the Dean of Students Office and are expected to complete the degree without further interruption.
Students in good standing may request a personal leave of absence (withdrawal) from a dean at any time. If a student is granted a personal leave of absence after the semester begins, but before the end of 10 class days, the transcript will list the date of withdrawal as the day before the term began. If a personal leave is allowed after the end of the 10th class day but before the end of week twelve of the term, the transcript will list the date of withdrawal and the courses in progress, each with a “W.” If a personal leave is granted after week 12 of the term, the transcript will show grades received, unless the student petitions for WIs (withdrawal due to illness).
