/italic/Kenyon College resolves to provide students with the most up-to-date information that governs student life; however, policies typically do not change mid-year.  If changes are made via amendment by Campus Senate, those changes will be reflected on the College website.  Excepting those amendments, a fixed version (i.e., hard copy) of all College policies, rules, and regulations (described herein), plus the following three documents — Campus Government Constitution, Campus Government Constitution: Senate Statutes, and Student Council By-Laws — is provided to each campus senator, Student Council member, and community advisor by the end of the first week of each school year.  A copy of all documents is also on reserve at the library./enditalic/
