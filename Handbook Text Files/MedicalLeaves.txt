Students with medical and/or psychological conditions that warrant withdrawal from the College may request leaves of absence from a dean at any time and, if granted, withdraw from the College. Verification of the condition, along with a recommendation for the leave, must be provided from an appropriate health care professional.
If a student withdraws for medical and/or psychological reasons, the transcript will indicate the date of withdrawal and WIs for each course.
Readmission is contingent upon the medical condition being sufficiently resolved or managed successfully so as to enable the student to resume successful progress toward the degree. While on leave, students are expected to seek necessary or appropriate medical attention and to document the steps taken and progress made. This information will be requested and made part of the readmission process along with assessments from appropriate medical and/or psychological professionals. Additional information may be sought and might include a personal interview and input from family members, employers or others who interacted with the student while on leave. In cases where there has been significant psychiatric or psychotherapeutic involvement, the student may be required to meet with a member of the Collegeâ€™s psychological counseling staff in advance of readmission and/or as a condition of continued enrollment. Final decisions about readmission are made by the Dean of Students Office.
