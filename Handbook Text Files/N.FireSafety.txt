Where required by Ohio law, Kenyon will report fire-safety violations to law enforcement authorities for investigation and possible criminal charges. Fire is a serious and constant threat to persons and property. Over its history, Kenyon has suffered great loss due to fire, including the loss of human life. As a result, the College takes very seriously issues related to fire safety. Kenyon is served by the College Township Fire Department.
Each student residence will be organized for fire protection, and periodic fire drills will be held throughout the academic year. Residences are to be evacuated immediately whenever a fire alarm sounds, day or night. In addition, all College living spaces are inspected by College personnel for issues of maintenance, health, and fire safety throughout the year. Students are expected to cooperate fully in these matters and to be conscious of fire-safety precautions.
