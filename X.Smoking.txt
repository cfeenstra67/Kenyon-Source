The College recognizes that smoking is hazardous to both the smoker and the nonsmoker. Smoking is not permitted in any College building, including all residence halls, apartments, houses, and academic and administrative buildings. Smokers are asked to respect smoking guidelines and smoke only in designated areas. This rule applies to all campus buildings and all outdoor athletic competitions (with the understanding that, at athletic events, parking areas are designated smoking areas). Smoking in the area immediately adjacent to locations of ingress or egress to a public place or place of employment is against Ohio law, and anyone smoking outside of a nonresidential building is expected to uphold this aspect of the law. Hookahs, even those used to smoke tobacco, are not permitted on College property. As of Jan. 1, 2013, smoking by students is restricted to predominantly residential areas, apart from designated smoking areas elsewhere on campus. Smokers within residential areas will maintain a distance of 15 feet from all entrances, exits and windows of residence halls and public buildings. Students found responsible for violating restrictions will be administered sanctions by the Collegeâ€™s Student Conduct Review System. Students found responsible for smoking indoors may lose one housing lottery point in the next lottery entered.
