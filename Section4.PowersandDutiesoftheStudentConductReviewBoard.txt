• The Student Conduct Review Board shall hear those cases of alleged violation of the nonacademic rules of the College by individuals or groups as described above. The Student Conduct Review Board shall make the determination of non-responsibility or responsibility, and if appropriate, a sanction, and it shall forward a letter outlining its findings to the student(s) or group with a copy to the referring administrator and to the administrative liaison.
• The Student Conduct Review Board does not have the power to set aside established student rights or College regulations, or the procedures established by the Senate for the implementation of the College conduct process. However, it may institute, as it deems necessary, rules for its own internal organization, one copy of which must be filed with the referring administrator and administrative liaison.
• If a board member has any potential conflict of interest in a case, he or she is expected to disqualify himself or herself from that particular hearing. The respondent and/or complainant may request that the administrative liaison disqualify a board member from a hearing. Examples for requesting the disqualification include, but are not limited to: current or former attendance in a board member’s class; current or former roommate/teammate, etc.
• All hearings shall be closed to the public. Those attending hearings will be limited to: Student Conduct Review Board members, complainant(s), respondent(s) and any advisor he/she/they elect to bring, the administrative liaison, a Student Council observer and witness(es) for the case. Any persons with an interest in the case but not participating in the hearing may not be present in the building in which the hearing is taking place. The witnesses shall remain together in a separate room.
• The Student Conduct Review Board shall issue to the community through campus media each semester a summary of violations and sanctions (without names) to increase understanding of, and respect for, the rules of the College and the rights and responsibilities of the individuals or groups.
• There shall be, as a general guideline, serious efforts to establish and maintain clear lines of communication between the Student Conduct Review Board and other interested College bodies.
