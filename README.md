# Kenyon-Source
This is the iOS application I originally wrote last summer for students of Kenyon College (where I just graduated from).  I used this application as a way to learn Objective C and iOS development primarily, so I would imagine there are many pieces of code that could be improved if I had the inclination.  As of June 5, 2017 this app is no longer available on the iTunes Store (Apple Developer account ran out, and I don't have a reason to renew it for the time being).  Note that if you download this code and run the app, there is one feature that will not work: The wall.  This was a feature I implemented which allowed users to post messages anonymously to a common message board, but it depends on CloudKit which is a service that is not available without an Apple Developer membership.
