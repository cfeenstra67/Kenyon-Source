Implementation of this policy shall be as timely and expeditious as possible, while careful to avoid undue haste. It should be noted that in some situations — particularly those in which a mandatory withdrawal is involved — it is in neither the student’s nor the College’s interest to delay emergency action.
The dean of student or designee may impose a mandatory withdrawal according to applicable criteria noted above.
The dean or designee shall be responsible for advising the student of the mandatory withdrawal and the processes for an informal hearing to resolve the student’s status. When feasible, the student shall be afforded the opportunity to review with the dean or designee the rationale for the leave/withdrawal. The student may have support persons present, including parents and medical or mental health professionals familiar with the student’s case. In no event may the student be accompanied by legal counsel at such informal hearing or related meeting to review the rationale for the leave/withdrawal.
If a mandatory withdrawal is imposed, an informal hearing to determine the student’s status will be scheduled by the dean or designee. The time of this hearing shall be set to permit ample time for information gathering related to the student’s illness, condition or behavior. This may necessitate and include an indefinite period of leave/withdrawal pending such information gathering.
