The quality of College life depends largely upon the personal integrity of students.  Dishonesty in any form is an extremely serious offense that may result in suspension or dismissal from the College.  Instances of dishonesty include, but are not limited to, presenting, using and/or possessing a falsified ID or another’s ID (K-Card) as one’s own; misrepresentation; furnishing false information; and falsification or forgery of documents.  Questions of academic honesty are addressed by procedures established by the faculty (refer to the /italic/Kenyon College Catalog/enditalic/).
